Exercises and Semester Projects for the Robotics II course of NTUA (8th semester).  
The repository contains:  
- **Semester Project 1:** A simulation of a **Redundant Robotic Manipulator**. The objective is that the end
effector can successfully follow a specific path while at the same time avoiding the obstacles placed around it.
For the simulation to be produced, **ROS** was used.

- **Semester Project 2A:** A simulation of a **Mobile Robot (differential drive)**. The objective is to implement
a wall following algorithm, so that the robot can keep a fixed distance from the circular walls, while moving in
parallel to them. For the simulation to be produced, **ROS** was used.
