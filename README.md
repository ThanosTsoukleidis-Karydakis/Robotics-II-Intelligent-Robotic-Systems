Exercises and Semester Projects for the Robotics II course of NTUA (8th semester).  
The repository contains:  
- **Semester Project 1:** A simulation of a **Redundant Robotic Manipulator**. The objective is that the end
effector can successfully follow a specific path while at the same time avoiding the obstacles placed around it.
For the simulation to be produced, **ROS** was used.
